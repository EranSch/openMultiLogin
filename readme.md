openMultiLogin
---

A de-obfuscated, republishing of the super-handy MultiLogin extension with the connection back to a home server removed and the goal of becoming completely open source and safe to use.

Update

Well folks, it's been quite a ride but I'm getting tired of dealing with the Chrome Store on this. I received a notice that the listing for openMultiLogin (old URL above) was reported as copyright infringement, under the DMCA. Because this code is technically an infringment, it's not really something I feel like pushing back on, despite the fact that the reporter is obviously up to some shadiness. 

Despite being the legitamate author, the reporter of the infringment hosts two semi-duplicate extension listings under the original name ("**MultiLogin**") and the name of this extension ("**openMultiLogin**"). The super shady part is that both listings actually use _my_ description text, including links to this repo! (**NOTE**: If you arrived here from either of these listings, please be aware that I am not the author for those extensions. **Use them at your own risk!**)

Thank you, everyone who participated and strived to help push this strange open source experience along. I'll leave this repo up if you want to pull the source. Enjoy!
