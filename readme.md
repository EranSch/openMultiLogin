**UPDATE: I'm officially giving up on dealing with the Chrome Store. The extension was taken down once again, this time under the DMCA. Frankly, at this point, I'm just too damn old and too damn tired to deal with this anymore. Read more and/or discuss [here](https://github.com/Swingline0/openMultiLogin/issues/20). Thanks for the fun ride, everyone. Take care and be safe!**
